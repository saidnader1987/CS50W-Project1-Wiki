# loMap

#### Description: Loans management application

## Concept

_Lomap_ is a management application for your loans. It's written in Python and uses several standard libraries and packages. The user interaction with the program is 100% via the command line.

With this program you can manage a database for your loans and the amortizations you pay for those loans, and ultimately it can show you valuable reports of your data such as cash flows.

## How it works

First you need to add banks to the database, then you add loans and finally you add amortizations for those loans. You can also edit and delete data provided no rule is violated. All your data is stored in 3 different csv files: one for loans, one for amortizations and one for banks.

Each time the program starts, it loads all data and perform calculations for additional data that you can later view in reports.
Each time you add, edit or delete a loan, a bank or an amortization, the csv files are saved with the latest changes.

The data you input when you create, edit or delete data is constrained by basic rules as I will later explain. You can interact with the program via 2 options: Manage and Reports.

## Manage

In this option you can create, edit and delete data such as banks, loans and amortizations.

### Data

- Your banks are stored in a file called banks.csv and are identified by a unique id
- Your amortizations are stored in a file called amortizations.csv and are identified by a unique id
- Your loans are stored in a file called loans.csv and are identified by a unique id

### Rules

1. Banks

- Id is set automatically and can not be modified
- The same bank can not be added to the database twice
- You can not delete a bank that is being used by a loan

2. Loans

- Id is set automatically and can not be modified
- One bank in database is the minimum requirement for adding loans
- Loan face value must be a positive integer or float
- Loan bank must be in the banks database
- Loan issue date must be a valid date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Loan term must be a positive integer in months. Floats are not allowed
- Loan payment frequency and interest paymente frequency can be set to monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually and at maturity and must match loan term. Namely, you can not have a bi-monthly payment frequency if your term is 3 months, because otherwise you will be missing 1 month. Don't worry about the math, the program will do it for you and explain when something is awry
- Loan interest rate must be a positive integer or float between 0 and 100 percent
- Loan interest rate type can be set to effective or to nominal. If it's set to effective the nominal rate compounding period is automatically set to annually
- Conversely, if loan ineterst rate type is set to nominal, the nominal rate compounding period can be set to monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annually and annually
- You can not delete a loan that has amortizations associated with it

3. Amortizations

- Id is set automatically and can not be modified
- You can only add amortizations to previously created loans. One loan in database is the minimum requirement for adding amortizations
- Amortization value can not be greater than loan principal (the ammount of money you owe for a loan at any particular time)
- Amortization date can not be greater than current date and must be in loan's range. That is, amortization date must be greater than loan issue date and lesser than or equal to loan maturity date (issue date + term)

You can freely edit and delete any entry in loans, amortizations and banks database as long as the change you made does not violate any rule. For instance, if you have already an amortization for a loan on a specific date, when you try to edit that loan issue date, you must take into account the date of that amortization. Conversely, if the loan does not have amortizations yet, you can freely edit its issue date.

## Reports

In this option you can view reports of your data.

### Loans report

A report containing all the basic data of your loans

### Amortizations report

A report containing all the basic data of your amortizations

### Banks report

A report containing all the basic data of your banks

### Cash flow

This is where all the magic happens, where all of the financial math is applied. You must choose a loan and then the program will print a report containing the following information:

- A row for each month of your loan from issue date to maturity date
- A column for the scheduled principal (money you owe each period for a particular loan) according to the amortization payment schedule
- Two columns for the scheduled amortization and interest payments according to the basic data of your loan (i.e. interest rate, payment frequencies, rate type, etc.). These columns **do not take into account the amortizations already made**
- A column for your actual amortizations (not to be confused with the scheduled amortizations). The amortization is placed on the period it took place; for instance if the issue date of the loan is the first of January 2022, and the first amortization was on January 23rd, the amortization will be shown on the first of February 2022 (the period it took place) for simplicity.
- Two columns for the actual scheduled amortization and actual scheduled interest payments **taking into account the amortizations already made**
- A column for the actual scheduled principal **taking into account the amortizations already made**

And that's it, that's loMap. it's very intuitive and it will provide you explanations for each step and each rule you violate. I hope you have fun with it.
